**VIEW** - virtual table based on a SELECT query

**base tables** - the tables on which a view is based

You can create a view using the **CREATE VIEW** command.

```
CREATE VIEW viewname AS SELECT query
```
### Updatable Views
**batch update routine** - is commonly used to update a product's quantity on hand based on summary sales transactions. Such routines are typically run as overnight batch jobs to update the quantity on hand products in inventory.

A relational view has several special characteristics: 
- you can use the name of a view anywhere a table name is expected in a SQL statement
- views are dynamically updated. That is, the view is re-created on demand each time it is invoked. Therefore, if new products are added or deleted to meet the criterion P_PRICE > 50.00, those new products will automatically appear or disappear in the PRICEGT50 view the next time the view is invoked. 

- Views provide a level of security in the databse because they can restrict users to seeing only specified columns and rows in a table. For example, if you have a company with hundreds of employees in several departments, you could give each department secretary a view of certain attributes only for the employees who belong to that secretarys department.

- views may also be used as the basis for reports. For example, if you need a report that shows a summary of total product cost and quantity on hand statistics grouped by vendor, you could create a prod_stats view as:
