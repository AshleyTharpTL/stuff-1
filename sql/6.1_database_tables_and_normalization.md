How do you recognize poor table structure and how do you produce a good table?

**Normalization** - is the process for evaluating and correcting table structures to minimize data redundancies, thereby reducing the likelihood of data anomalies.

Generally the higher the normal form, the more relational join operations you need to produce a specified output. Also, more reources are required by the database system to respond to end-user queries. A successful design must also consider end-user demand for fast performance. There you will occasionally need to denormalize some portions of databse design to meet performance requirements. Denormalization produces a lower normal form.
