We will learn INSERT, SELECT, COMMIT, UPDATE, ROLLBACK, and DELETE

### ADDING table rows
INSERT to add data into a table, 
```
INSERT INTO tablename VALUES(v1, v2, v3)
```

Here are some rules: 
- the row contents are entered between parens. One right after VALUES, the command ends with a paren after the last value.

- Character string and date values must be entered betweeen apostrophes

- Numerical entries are not enclosed in apostrophes

- attribute entries are separated by commas

- a value is required for each column in the table

### Inserting Rows with Null Attributes
Just put a NULL for the value

### Inserting Rows with Optional Attributes 
sometimes more than one attribute is optional. Rather than declaring each attribute as NULL in the INSERT command, you can indicate just the attributes that have required values. You do that by listing the attribute names inside parentheses after the table name. For the purpose of this example, assume that the only required attributes for the PRODUCT table are P_CODE and P_DESCRIPT
