UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT (MINUS) work properly if relations are **union compatible**, which means that the number of attributes must be the same and their corresponding data types must be a alike. 

SQL data manipulation commands are **set-oriented** - that is they operate oer entire sets of rows and columns (tables) at once.

The UNION statement combines rows from two or more queries without including duplicate rows. The syntax of the UNION statement is: 
```
query UNION query
```
You can chain together all the queries you want, it's very convenient.

```
SELECT columnlist FROM T1
UNION
SELECT columnlist FROM T2
UNION
SELECT columnlist FROM T3
UNION
SELECT columnlist FROM T4;
```

**UNION ALL** - can be used to produce a relation that keeps all the duplicate rows.
Like the UNION statement, can be used to unite more than two queries.

**INTERSECT** can be used to see which records are duplicated in two databases. INTERSECT can be used to combine the rows from two queries and then only return the results that appear in both sets.

```
query INTERSECT query
```

Let's look at an example. Suppose that we want to know all of the customers that live in area code 615 that have also made a purchase. We can intersect two queries to get this result.

```
SELECT CUS_CODE FROM CUSTOMER WHERE CUS_AREACODE = '615'
INTERSECT
SELECT DISTINCT CUS_CODE FROM INVOICE;
```
### EXCEPT (MINUS)
The EXCEPT statement in SQL combines rows from two queries and returns only the rows that appear in the first set but not in the second.
