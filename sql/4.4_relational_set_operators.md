UNIONN, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT work properly if relations are **union compatible**, which means that the number of attributes must be the same and their corresponding data types must be a alike. 

The UNION statement combines rows from two or more queries without including duplicate rows. The syntax of the UNION statement is: 
```
query UNION query
```

**UNION ALL** - can be used to produce a relation that keeps all the duplicate rows.
Like the UNION statement, can be used to unite more than two queries.

**INTERSECT** can be used to see which records are duplicated in two databases.

```
query INTERSECT query
```
