join tables by putting more than one table as args to the FROM clause in your command

It will do all the joining stuff for you. 

### Joining Tables with an Alias
an alias may be used to identify the source table from which the data is taken. The aliases P and V are used to label the PRODUCT and VENDOR TABLES in the next command sequence. Any legal table name may be used as an alias

```
SELECT P_DESCRIPTT, P_PRICE, V_NAME, V_CONTACT, V_AREACODE, V_PHONE
FROM PRODUCT P, VENDOR V
WHERE P.V_CODE = V.V_CODE
ORDER BY P_PRICE;
```

### Recursive Joins
Example: 
```
SELECT E.EMP_NUM, E.EMP_LNAME, E.EMP_MGR, M.EMP_LNAME
FROM EMP E, EMP M
WHERE E.EMP_MGR=M.EMP_NUM
ORDER BY E.EMP_MGR
```

ok, whatever, I don't get it, so two aliases to reference the same table, big deal, and we get the employee numbers of the managers and then pair it with the employees they are the managers of. yeah I'm just not clear and when I should and should not use this pattern
