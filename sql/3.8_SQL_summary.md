- sql commands can be divided into two overall categories: data definition language (DDL) commands and data minupulation langugage (DML) commands

- The ANSI standard data types are supported by all RDBMA vendors in different ways. The basic data types are NUMBER, NUMERIC, INTEGER, CHAR, VARCHAR, AND DATE.

- The basic data definition commands allow you to create tables and indexes. Many SQL constraints can be used with columns. The commands are CREATE TABLE, CREATE INDEX, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE, and DROP INDEX.

- dml COMMANDS ALLOW YOU TO ADD, MODIFY, AND DELETE ROWS FROM TABLES. THE BASIC dmL commands are SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, COMMIT and ROLLBACK

- the INSERT command is used to add new rows to tables. The UPDATE command is used to modify data values in existing rows of a table. The DELETE command is used to delete rows from tables. The COMMIT and ROLLBACK commands are used to permanently save or roll back changes made to the rows. Once you COMMIT the changes, you cannot undo them with the ROLLBACK command.

The select command has the following syntax:
```
SELECT columnlist
FROM tablelist
[WHERE conditionlist]
[GROUP BY columnlist]
[HAVING conditionlist]
[ORDER BY columnlist [ ASC | DESC ] ];
```

- The column list represents one or more column names separated by commas. The column list may also include computed columns, aliases, and aggrate functions. A computed column is represented by an expression or formula (for example, P_PRICE*P_QOH) The FROM clause contains a list of table names. 

- The WHERE clause can be used with the SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements to restrict the rows affected by the DML command. The condition list represents one or more conditional expressions separated by logical operators (AND, OR and NOT) The conditional expression can contain any comparison operators (-, >, <, >=, <=, and <>) as well as special operators (BETWEEN, IS NULL, LIKE, IN, and EXISTS)

- aggregate functions (COUNT, MIN, MAX, and AVG) are special functions that perform arithmetic computations over a set of rows. The aggregate functions are usually used in conjunction with the GROUP BY clause to group the output of aggregate computation by one or more attributes. The HAVING clause is used to restrict the output of the GROUP BY clause by selcting only the aggregate rows that match a given condition.

- The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the output of a SELECT statement. The ORDER BY clause can sort by one or more columns and can use either ascending or descending order. 

- You can join the output of multiple tables with the SELECT statement. The join operation is performed every time you specify two or more tables in the FROM clause and use a join condition in the WHERE clause to match the foreign key of one table to the primary of the related table. If you do not specify a join condition, the DBMS will automatically perform a Cartesian product of the tables you specify in the FROM clause.

- The natural join uses the join condition to match only rows with equal values in the specified columns.
