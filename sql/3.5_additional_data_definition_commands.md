the ALTERTABLE command can take the arguments ADD, MODIFY, or DROP

You can add a column, 
```
ALTER TABLE tablename {ADD | MODIFY } (columnname datatype);
```

or you can ADD a constraint 
```
ALTER TABLE tablename ADD constraint [ ADD constraint ];
```

Use it to drop a column or table constraint
```
ALTER TABLE tablename DROP { PRIMARY KEY | COLUMN columnname | CONSTRAINT constraintname };
```

### Changing a Columns Datatype
```
ALTER TABLE PRODUCT MODIFY (V_CODE CHAR(5));
```
Here is just changed a vendor code from a numeric type into a string type. This makes sense if we never have to perform arithmetic on a number code, then it should be stored as a string instead of a numeric.


### Update commands
```
UPDATE PRODUCT SET P_SALECODE = '2' WHERE P_CODE = '1546-QQ2';
```

for upating existing rows, use INSERT to create new rows.

### Copying parts of Tables
```

### Adding Primary and Foreign key Designations
When you create a new table based on another table, the new table does not include integrity rules from the old table. In particular there is no primary key. To define the primary key for the new PART table, use the following command 
```
ALTER TABLE PART ADD PRIMARY_KEY (PART_CODE);
```
