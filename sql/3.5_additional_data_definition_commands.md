the ALTERTABLE command can take the arguments ADD, MODIFY, or DROP

You can add a column, 
```
ALTER TABLE tablename {ADD | MODIFY } (columnname datatype);
```

or you can ADD a constraint 
```
ALTER TABLE tablename ADD constraint [ ADD constraint ];
```

Use it to drop a column or table constraint
```
ALTER TABLE tablename DROP { PRIMARY KEY | COLUMN columnname | CONSTRAINT constraintname };
```

### Changing a Columns Datatype
```
ALTER TABLE PRODUCT MODIFY (V_CODE CHAR(5));
```
Here is just changed a vendor code from a numeric type into a string type. This makes sense if we never have to perform arithmetic on a number code, then it should be stored as a string instead of a numeric.


### Update commands
```
UPDATE PRODUCT SET P_SALECODE = '2' WHERE P_CODE = '1546-QQ2';
```

for upating existing rows, use INSERT to create new rows.

### Copying parts of Tables
```

### Adding Primary and Foreign key Designations
When you create a new table based on another table, the new table does not include integrity rules from the old table. In particular there is no primary key. To define the primary key for the new PART table, use the following command 
```
ALTER TABLE PART ADD PRIMARY_KEY (PART_CODE);
```
### Ordering a Listing
Order by to show things in order

```
SELECT columnlist FROM tableList [WHERE conditionlist] [ORDER BY columnlist [ASC | DESC ]]
```

### Listing Unique Values
```
SELECT DISTINCT V_CODE FROM PRODUCT;
```
Show all the distrinct vendors

### Aggregate Values
**count** - the number of rows containing non null values
** min** - the min attribute value encountered in a given column
**max** - the max attribute value encountered in a given column
**sum** - the sum of all values for a given column
**avg** - the arithmetic mean (average) for a specified column

Example: 
```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tablename WHERE condition

```

just returns the number of entries that meet the condition from the specified table.

### Grouping Data

```
SELECT columnlist FROM tablelist
WHERE conditionList
GROUP BY columnList
HAVING conditionList
ORDER BY columnList [ASC|DESC];
```

You may want to group sales by salesperson for example.

The GROUP BY clause is valid only when used in conjunction with one of the SQL aggrggate functions, such as COUNT, MIN, MAX, AVG, and SUM.
