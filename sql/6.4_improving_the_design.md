Evaluate PK Assignments: Each time a new employee is entered into the EMPLOYEE table, a JOB_CLASS value must be entered. Unfortunately it is too easy to make data entry errors that lead to referential integrity violations. For example, entering DB Designer instead of Databse Designer for the JOB_CLASS attribute in the EMPLOYEE table will trigger such a violation. Therefore, it would be better to add a JOB_CODE attribute to create a unique identifier.

So, now we have this dependency:
```
JOB_CODE -> JOB_CLASS, CHG_HOUR
```
