### Summary
- operations that join tables can be classified as inner joins and outer joins. 
- An inner join is a traditional join in which only rows that meet a given criterion are selected. An ourer join returns the matching rows as well as the rows with unmatched attribute values for one tableor both tables to be joined. 

- A natural join returns all rows with matching values in the matching columns and eliminates duplicate columns. This style of query is used when the tables share a common attribute with a common name. One important difference between the syntax for a natural join and for the old style join is that the natural join does not require the use of a table qualifier for the common attributes. In practice, natural joins are often discouraged because teh common attribute is not specified within the command, making queries more difficult to understand and maintain.

- Joins may use keywords such as USING and ON. If the USING clause is used, the query will return only the rows with matching values in the column indicated in the USING clause; that column must exist in both tables. If the ON clause is used, the query qill return only the rows that meet the specified join condition.

- Subqueries and correlated queries are used when it is necessary to process data based on other processed data. That is, the query uses results that were previously unknown and that are generated by another query. Subqueries may be used with the FROM, WHERE, IN, and HAVING clauses in a SELECT statement. A subquery may return a single row or multiple rows.
