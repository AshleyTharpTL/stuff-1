**Schema** - a logical group of db objects
The schema usually belongs to a user. Seldom directly used, more often is created by the DBMS when a user is created. 

```
CREATE SCHEMA AUTHORIZATION {creator};

```

### Create Table
```
CREATE TABLE tableName (
column1 data type [constraint],
column2 data type [constraint],
PRIMARY_KEY (column1 [, column2]),
[FOREIGN_KEY (column1 [, column2]) REFERENCES tablename],
[CONSTRAINT constraint ] );

```

Notice here that you can make two types of constraints, you can pass it in as an arg to a column, or you can apply to the table you are making using the constraint keyword.

Example: we pass NOT NULL as constraint to these columns, but then we pass several table constraints here:
```
CREATE TABLE CUSTOMER (
CUS_CODE NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
CUS_LNAME VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
CUS_FNAME VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
CUS_INITIAL CHAR(1),
CUS_AREACODE CHAR(3) DEFAULT '615' NOT NULL
CHECK(CUS_AREACODE IN
('615','713',931')),
CUS_PHONE CHAR(8) NOT NULL,
CUS_BALANCE NUMBER(9,2) DEFAULT 0.00,
CONSTRAINT CUS)UI1 UNIQUE (CUS_LNAME, CUS_FNAME));

```

Lets look at this example:
We're going to create a table called INVOICE. We;re going to use DEFAULT constraint to assign a default date to a new invoice, and the CHECK constraint validates that the invoice date is greater than Jan 1 2016

```
CREATE TABLE INVOICE (
INV_NUMBER NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
CUS_CODE NUMBER NOT NULL REFERENCES CUSTOMER(CUS_CODE),
INV_DATE DATE DEFAULT SYSDATE NOT NULL,
CONSTRAINT INV_CK1 CHECK (INV_DATE > TO_DATE('01-JAN-2016',
'DD-MON-YYYY')));

```
Let's look at this other example: 
We're going to create a table called LINE
We're going to use a UNIQUE constraint to prevent the duplication of an invoice line. 
We're going to use ON DELETE CASADE foreign key to enforce referential integrity.

```
CREATE TABLE LINE (
INV_NUMBER NUMBER NOT NULL,
LINE_NUMBER NUMBER(2,0) NOT NULL,
P_CODE VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
LINE_UNITS NUMBER(9,2) DEFAULT 0.00 NOT NULL,
LINE_PRICE NUMBER(9,2) DEFAULT 0.00 NOT NULL,
PRIMARY_KEY (INV_NUMBER, LINE_NUMBER),
FOREIGN_KEY (INV_NUMBER) REFERENCES INVOICE (INV_NUMBER) ON DELETE CASCADE,
FOREIGN)KEY (P_CODE) REFERENCES PRODUCT(P_CODE),
CONSTRAINT LINE_UI1 UNIQUE(INV_NUMBER, P_CODE));

```
The use of ON DELETE CASCADE is recommended for weak entities to ensure that the deletion of a row in the strong entity automatically triggers the deletion of the corresponding rows in the dependent weak entity. in that case, the deletion of an INVOICE row will automatically delete all of the LINE rows related to the invoice.

### SQL INDEXES
```
CREATE [UNIQUE] INDEX indexname ON tablename(column1)
```

its common to create an index on any field that is used as a search key, in comparison operations in a conditional experssion, or when you want to list rows in a specific order.

we can avoid duplication by using a unique composite index. 
For example, lets use EMP_NUM, TEST_CODE, and TEST_DATE	

```
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX EMP_TESTDEX ON TEST(EMP_NUM, TEST_CODE, TEST_DATE);
```
