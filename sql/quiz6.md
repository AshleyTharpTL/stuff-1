2. Because a partial dependency can exist only when a table's primary key is composed of several attributes, a table whose primary key consists of only a single attribute is automatically in 2NF once it is in 1NF.

In the fourth normal form, you must be in 3NF and there must be no independent multivalued dependencies

In the fourth normal form, no row may contain two or more multivalued facts about an entity, 
Yeah, this seems totally useless in a business context, no row can more one fact about it?

Useless, 

A table that has all key attributes defined, has no repeating groups, and all its attributes are dependent on the primary key is said to be in 2NF

Any attribute that is at least part of a key is known as a prime attribute/key attribute

Improving atomicity leads to more flexbile queries.

When a table has only one candidate key the 3NF and the BCNF are considered to be equivalent.
