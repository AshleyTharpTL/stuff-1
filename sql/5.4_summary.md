- database performance tuning refers to a set of activities and procedures designed to ensure than an end user query is processed by the DBMS in the least amount of time. SQL performance tuning refers to activities on the client side that are designed to generate SQL code that reutrns the correct answer in the least amount of time. 

- We gather stats so that we can performance tune. The DBMS gathers stats about objects such as tables, indexes and available resources, which include the number of processors used, processor speed, and temporary space available. 

The DBMS uses the statistics to make critical decisions about improving query processing efficiency.

DBMS process queries in three phases. In the parsing phase, we parse the query and choose the most efficient access plan. 
Execution phase, we execute the query using the chosen access plan
Fetching phase, the DBMS fetches the data and send the result set back to the client.

- Indexes are crucial in the process that speeds up data access. Indexes facilitate searching, sorting, and using aggregate functions and join operations.

- during query optimization the DBMS must choose what indexes to use, how to perform join operations, which table to use first, and so on. Each DBMS has its own algorithms for determining the most efficient way to access data. The two most common approaches are rule based and cost based optimization. 

DBMS performance tuning includes tasks such as managing the DBMS processes in primary memory (allocating memory for caching purposes) and managing the structures in physical storage (allocating space for the data files)
