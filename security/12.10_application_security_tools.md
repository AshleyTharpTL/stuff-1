### Web Application Tools

Nikto and Wikto
a fee and open source web server analysis tool that will perform checks for many of the common vulnerabilities we mentioned at the beginning of this section and discussed earlier in the lesson when we went over server side security issues. 

Nikto will index all the files and directories it can see on the target web server, a process commonly referred to as spidering and will then locate any issues and report on them. 

Not everything reported will actually be a security problem. 

Such tools always give back false positives. 

Fuzzing: throws a bunch of input at an app to see if we can break it
