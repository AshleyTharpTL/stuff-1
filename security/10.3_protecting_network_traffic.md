### Virtual Private Networks
often referred to as a tunnel, is an encrypted connection between two points. 
Generally accomplished with a VPN client application on one end of the connection and a device called a VPN concentrator on the other end. 
The client uses the software to authenticate to the VPN concentrator, and after we connect, all traffic flows through the encrypted VPN tunnel.
