8. A new start up company has started working on a social networking website. The company has moved all of its source code to a cloud provider and wants to protect this source code from unauthorized access. 
Which cyber defense concept should the start up company use to maintain the confidentiality of its source code?

The answer is NOT account permissions. It is, FILE ENCRYPTION.

Think about, account permissions have nothing to do with UNAUTHORIZED access. If the access is unauthorized, permissions aren't going to make a bit of difference, but file encryption will. 

I think I was just confused by this answer because, I regularly use Github, which is a cloud provider, but I don't think I've ever had to think about encrypting the code I put up there, I just didn't have the association mentally in my head.

31. A module in a security awareness course shows a user making use of two-factor authentication using a hardware token. Which security failure is being addressed by this training module?

The answer is NOT pretexting. I had though it was bc I was assuming someone watching me type in my password could be pretexting but it is not. Pretending you can't get your badge out of your pocket because your hands are full is a type of pretexting, not that. Pretexting is basically a type of fakery or social engineering so that you can bypass some security obstacle.

The answer is actually, weak passwords. The antedote to weak passwords is two factor authentication because even if a hacker can guess the password, it is unlikely the hacker will also have the second facter (usually a cell phone or email account)
