Possesion

Authenticity

Utility

Parker defines integrity a little different. He doesn't account for authorized but incorrect data modifications and instead focus on the state of the data inself in the sense of completeness.

### Possession or control
Possession or control refers to the physical disposition of the media on which the data is stored. This enables us, wo involving other factors such as availability, to discuss our loss of the data in its physical medium. If we lost a shipment of tapes lets say some were encrypted and some were not. The principle of possession would enable us to more accurately describe the scope of the incident; the encrypted tapes in the lot are a possession problem but not a confidentiality problem, and the unencrypted tapes are a problem on bouth counts. 

### Authenticity
Authenticity allows us to talk about the proper attribution as to the owner or creator of the data in question. For example, if we send an email message that is altered so as to appear to have come from a different email address than the one from which it was actually sent, we would be violating the authenticity of the email. Authenticity can be enforced through the use of digital signatures. A very similar but reversed concept to this is nonrepudiation. 

Nonrepudiation prevents someone from taking an action, such as sending an email, and then later denying that s/he has done so. This is critical to ecommerce and is defined by the law governing these transactions.

### Utility
Utility refers to how useful the data is to us. Utility is also the only principle of the Parkerian Hexad that is not necessarily binary in nature. We can have various degrees of utility. 

For an attacker, or other unauthorized person, the encrypted tapes would likely be of low utility since they can't use, but the unencrypted tapes would be of high utility.
