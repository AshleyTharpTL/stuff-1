for limiting access we will often see the term sandbox used to describe the limitations that are put in place.

A sandbox is simply a set of resources devoted to a program, process, or similar entity, outside of which the entity cannot operate.

We use sandboxes to prevent their contents from accessing files, memory and other sysrtem resource with which they should not be interacting.

Sandboxes can be very useful for containing stuff we don't trust such as code from public seb sites. 
The JVM Java virtual machine is an example of a sandbox in use. Java Programs run inside the JVM sandbox.

THe JVM acts as a mediator to protect users against potntially malicious software that they might download.
