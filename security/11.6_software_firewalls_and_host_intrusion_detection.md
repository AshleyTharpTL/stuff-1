### Software Firewalls
useually don't have as much stuff as a hardware firewall but will do the trick.
we can find simple ones that ship with our os, to complex enterprise versions

### Host Intrusion Detection
HIDS analyze the activities on or directed at the network interface of a particular host. They have many of the same advantages as network based intrusion detection systems (NIDS) have but with a considerably reduced scope of operation. 

As with software firewallsw, such tools may range from simple to complex. 

A flag, in order to report the attack to maanagement mechanism in real time, the info needs to be commo over a network. If the host in question is being actively attacked over the same network, well that's a fail.

We can attempt to remedy this by sending a regular beacon from the device to the management mechanism, allowing us to assume a problem if we don't get the regular pings anymore.
