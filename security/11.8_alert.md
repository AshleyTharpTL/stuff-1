### Vulnerability Assessment Tools
Tenables Nessus, was once a free tool, but now there is a premium mode. Nessus will conduct a port scan on a target, then attempt to determine what services and versions of service are running on any ports if finds open. Nessus will then report back with a specific list of vulnerabilities that we mgiht find on a given device. 

As we mentioned, Nessus as a part of its feature set, include a port scanner, as a port scan is needed in order to find the listening services before we can identify the vulnerabilities that might be resident in them. 

You can also add custom features to the tool with the Nessus Attack Scripting Language NASL

### Exploit Frameworks
The exploit

Exploit Frameworks such as Rapid7's Metasploit as shown in Figure 11.5, Immunity Canvas and Core Impact provide large sets of prepackaged exploits in order to make them simple to use and to make a larger library available to us then we might have if we had to put them together individually. 

These are commonly used in penetration testing.
