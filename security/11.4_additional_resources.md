Anomaly detection is sometimes called heuristics.

Anti-malware software usually just heavily relies on Signatures.

The software usually quarantines the suspicious files and removes their ebility to execute. It may not destroy them bc it could be a false positive.

ASLR - Address space layout randomization in order to shift the contents of the memory in use so that tampering with it is even more difficult.
