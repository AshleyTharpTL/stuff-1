Here are the steps in order:

1. Identification of critical information: Identyify the critical items of information on which everything else depends.

2. Analysis of Threats: Determine what hard could happen if a piece of critical information is exposed and who might exploit the exposure.

3. Analysis of Vulnerabilities: A systematic evaluation to detect vulnerabilities. This should be viewed as an adversary to get the information. 

4. Assessment of Risks: the process of matching a vulnerability against each threat, then deciding if the resultant risk warrants applications of countermeasures. 

5. Application of Countermeasures: Each risk is eliminated by mitigating either the threat or the vulnerability.
