Stuxnet - 2009, is when it started and then it kept growing and getting worse. It doesn't have a high body count but, it was super specific though, it targeted the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems that run some industrial processes.
In the case of this attack, it was a nation state attacking another nation states military capability.
