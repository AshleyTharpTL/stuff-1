Canonical List:

- Unauthenticated flaws in network protocols
- authenticated flaws in network protocols
- flaws in authentication protocols
- arbitrary code execution in intrinsic SQL elements
- arbitrary code execution in securable SQL elements
- privilege escalation via SQL injection
- local privilege escalation issues

### Protocol Issues
Just update your software
after that, just limit access to your database, 
by who is able to connect over the network, or, 
by limiting privs, 



Protocol Issues
- unauthenticated flaws in network protocols
- authenticated flaws in network protocols
- flaws in authentication protocols

Unauthenticated Access
- unauthenticated access to functionality

Arbitrary Code Execution
- Arbitrary code execution in intrinsic SQL elements
- arbitrary code execution in securable SQL elements

Privilege Escalation
- Priviledge escalation via SQL injection
- Local priviledge escalation issuES

### Unaithenticated Access
when we give them a token so they don't have to supply credentials, we create a possible security issue.

### Arbitrary Code Execution
SQL has flaws
some software has bugs
buffer overflow is an example
defense is to install all updates, and stay current
mandate secure coding practives, 
to eliminate the vulnerabilities in the first place,

### Privilege Escalation
sql injection is sometimes used to gain or escalate privileges
